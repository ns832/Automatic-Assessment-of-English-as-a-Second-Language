# Automatic-Assessment-of-English-as-a-Second-Language
4th year NLP project on detecting on and off-topic responses 

Within the project two main methods are explored: a zero-shot generative model using LLaVA/Mistral (LLaVA including the use of images whereas Mistral works purely based of text) and a bespoke BERT-based model. All files can be run from the command line with arguments used to locate the data and model parameters. The BERT is split into two with a train_BERT.py and eval_BERT.py, using different datasets for the training and evaluation stages.
